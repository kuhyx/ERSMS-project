\section{System Architecture} 
We have designed and implemented 4 microservices,
all of microservices are written in Python using Flask framework
\paragraph{AI recommendations}
Based on a list of movies ids, calculates and returns list of ids recommended for user who likes given movies
\paragraph{Analytics}
Holds information about number of 
ratings, number of users, 
average movie ratings, ratings of 
given user which are later used in 
webinterface to show data for admins 
concerning website usage
\paragraph{Notifications}
Notifies user whenever there is a new movie recommend by AI recommender for them 
\paragraph{Backend}
Updates database and mantains all ongoing and incoming communication between all microservices, both between microservies and from microservices to the webinterface
\paragraph{Caching}
We implemented two caches
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Backend is cached inside Analytics Service \\
    Analytics service holds tata about users and movies, 
    in order to not pull all the data from backend every time we update analytics
    (for example every day), we keep the cache of backend date in our analytics 
    service
    \item AI recommendations are cached inside Notification Service \\ 
    AI recommendations can change whenever new movie appears, notification 
    service keeps the cache of ai recommendation service in order to not 
    pull all the data from the ai recommendation every time it wants to notify 
    the users about new movies to recommend
\end{enumerate}
