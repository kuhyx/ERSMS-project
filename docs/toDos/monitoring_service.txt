Monitoring service 
Monitoring service should keep track of all communication 
send between all services 
Store logs with:
1. timestamp (when was a message send)
2. Message raw data 

To decide: 
    What to use for Monitoring service? 
    Maybe cloud service will provide us with functioning one?
    Maybe deployment tool already has one?
