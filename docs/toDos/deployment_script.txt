One script upon being ran should deploy the entire solution to some 
cloud service

It should:
1. Build everything 
2. Connect to cloud service (Azure?)
3. Send the data 

After it will be run website should be accessible under some address 
    (cloud service should provide this address?)

Decide:
    What cloud service? (Azure?) Requirements:
        a. Free (https://github.com/cloudcommunity/Cloud-Free-Tier-Comparison)
        b. Popular 
            AWS:
                +   Most popular 
                +   "Always" free
                +   AWS CDK available
            Azure 
                -Microsoft
            Google Cloud 
                +We have google accounts anyway
    What technology for script (Ansible?)
